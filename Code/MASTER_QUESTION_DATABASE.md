## NEXT STEP: Test Execution Plan

1. Test UI examples first (8 questions) - verify they work as shown
2. Test inventory questions by category - validate routing and accuracy
3. Trigger follow-ups naturally - test dynamic generation
4. Capture all: question + full answer + generated follow-ups + route + timing
5. Store in structured format for analysis
