This information is not currently available in our dataset.\n\n### Job Role Analysis\n\nSimilarly, for job role analysis, we require more granular data on employee roles and their distribution across departments. The current dataset does not include this level of detail.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo complete this analysis, we need to:\n1. Retrieve the latest demographic data by age group.\n2. Gather detailed information on job roles and departmental breakdowns.\n\n### Follow-Up Question\n\nCould you please provide the latest employee demographics by age group or a list of job roles and their distribution across departments?\n\n### Evidence Section\n\n- **Employee Headcount Overview**: [Reference to the provided dataset]\n- **Current Employee Distribution by State**: Sabah (151), Sarawak (145), Penang (137), Selangor (137), Kuala Lumpur (109)\n\nIf you have any additional information or if there are specific age groups or job roles you would like to focus on, please let me know.",
