Monitoring their performance trends is crucial to ensure sustained growth.\n\n## Recommended Actions\n1. **Enhanced Marketing Campaigns**:\n   - Develop targeted marketing strategies for both Burger Classic and Nasi Lemak Burger, focusing on social media and community engagement.\n2. **Product Diversification**:\n   - Introduce new menu items to reduce dependency on top sellers and attract a broader customer base.\n3. **Customer Feedback Loop**:\n   - Actively collect and analyze customer feedback to identify areas for improvement and innovation.\n\nBy focusing on these actions, the retail chain can maintain strong performance while exploring growth opportunities in diverse product offerings.",
