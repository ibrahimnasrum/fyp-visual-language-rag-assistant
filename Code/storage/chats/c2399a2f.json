Contract employees receive prorated annual leave as per their contract terms, with a minimum entitlement as specified by the company offer. Part-time employees are not eligible for annual leave unless stated in their employment terms.\n\n### Evidence Used\n- [DOC:HR_Policy_MY.txt] 6.1 Annual Leave (AL)\n\n### Assumptions/Limits\nThe policy does not specify how prorated leave is calculated, which could vary based on the employee's join date within the year.\n\n### Next Actions\n- Review and update the HR manual to ensure clarity on proration methods for annual leave.\n- Communicate the leave entitlements clearly to all employees through internal communications.",
