It does not provide a direct employee count but indicates that there is an emphasis on maintaining a skilled workforce.\n\n4. **HR Policy MY:**\n   - Document: [DOC:HR_Policy_MY.txt]\n   - Key Insight: This document outlines OT payment policies and HR procedures but does not specify the total number of employees.\n\n5. **State Operations KL (Additional Context):**\n   - Document: [DOC:State_Operations_KL.txt] (Customer Profile Section)\n   - Key Insight: While this section discusses customer profiles, it does not provide an employee count.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the available data, we do not have a direct count of employees for any specific state or overall.
